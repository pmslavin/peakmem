Building PeakMem is simple:

[1]  $  tar xzvf peakmem-1.0.0.tar.gz

[2]  $ cd peakmem-1.0.0/

[3]  $ ./configure
	- Provide PREFIX and build options as required.
	- For portability, the --enable-poll-proc-status
	  option allows /proc/<pid>/status to be read as
	  an alternative to the default /proc/<pid>/statm

[4]  $ make
	- A "$ make check" target is also provided.

[5]  $ make install


PeakMem is now available at $PREFIX/bin/peakmem
