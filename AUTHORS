PeakMem was developed as part of the Next-Generation Weather and
Climate Prediction (Gung-Ho) project by:

Paul Slavin <slavinp@cs.man.ac.uk>  University of Manchester

...and was originally used to monitor the memory requirements of
generating large cubed-sphere meshes for numerical finite-element
codes.
